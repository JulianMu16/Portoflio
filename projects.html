            of the dungeon generation script">
            <p>I created a roguelike dungeon crawler that uses a custom generator script
               built in C# that makes each playthrough unique. All characters and assets were
               designed by me with Piskel and animated through Unity.

            <img id="payloadImg" src="images/payload.jpg" alt="The weather balloon payload being
            weighed on a scale">
            <p>Along with other University of Michigan students, I executed a Weather
               balloon launch in order to gather data on the atmosphere. My contributions
               were programming scripts in Python and MATLAB which organized temperature,
               pressure, humidity, and GPS data. The payload completed a two hour flight,
               fifteen miles high into the air, before being successfully recovered.

            <img id="graph" src="images/graph2.png" alt="A graph displaying climate data">
            <p>Another University of Michigan student and I collaborated to create the
               "Alpha Centauri" climate anomaly detector. Built with Python, SQL, and PhantomJS
               it allows users to input global coordinates which it then compares with
               climate data via various API's. It outputs a comprehensive text file, 
               as well graphs which are generated using MATLAB shown above.
